                                        representing WB Govt, led by former Congressman Kapil Sibal, showed no remorse,

                                        the one thing he hasn't managed to do in his trailblazing career. He improved on
                                        his Paris throw of 89.45m by getting to 89.49m but his reaction to seeing where
                                        that javelin landed on the big screen says that he didn't care much for that.
                                        Neeraj thought that he had finally breached the 90m but he was less than 50
                                        centimetres behind that. Such are the margins in sports at the highest level.

                                        The daylong Bharat bandh on Wednesday, called by Dalit and tribal organisations
                                        and supported by opposition parties, against the Supreme Court's verdict on
                                        sub-classification of Scheduled Castes affected normal life mainly in Bihar and
                                        Jharkhand as well as tribal areas of various states. Police resorted to
                                        baton-charge on protestors in Patna and used water canons to disperse them,
                                        while people broke barricades and marched towards the Dak Bungalow Chowk. About
                                        10,000 people participated in the protest in various parts of Patna, with a
                                        large portion of protestors comprising students.

                                        Normal life was disrupted as bandh supporters staged ralliesand demonstrations
                                        in different parts of Jharkhand. The bandh had some impact in Gujarat's tribal
                                        belts, including in Chhota Udepur, Narmada, Surendranagra, Sabarkantha and
                                        Aravalli districts.
                                        Uttar Pradesh remained largely unaffected even as opposition BSP and SP extended
                                        their support to the bandh.

                                        tyre ablaze directly under the bus.

                                        The visuals showed the bus fully occupied by school children in uniform. The
                                        attempt, however, was thwarted by the police. The Bihar Police resorted to using
                                        lathi-charges and water cannons to scatter demonstrators who had set up
                                        blockades on railways and roads in support of the Bharat Bandh, which was
                                        organised to demand community-based reservation. The protesters caused
                                        disruptions to train services at the Darbhanga and Buxar railway stations. In
                                        addition, traffic flow was disrupted in several districts, including Patna,
                                        Hajipur, Darbhanga, Jehanabad, Purnea, Katihar, Muzaffarpur, and Begusarai. In
                                        response to these actions, the police employed baton-charges to disperse the
                                        protesters and restore order in the affected areas.

                                        The Patna district administration released a statement confirming that the Patna
                                        police filed three FIRs and took nine individuals into custody for allegedly
                                        taking matters into their own hands during the protests.

                                        In the district of Jehanabad, protesters and security personnel engaged in
                                        confrontations on National Highway-83 near Unta Chowk, resulting in the
                                        apprehension of five individuals.

                                        Protesters in various other districts, such as Madhepura, Muzaffarpur, Saran,
                                        Begusarai, Hajipur, Purnea, and Katihar, made attempts to obstruct traffic and
                                        set tyres ablaze. However, security forces swiftly intervened and dispersed the
                                        crowds.

                                        KYIV: When the full-scale war began in Feb 2022, it came as a bolt from the blue
                                        for the Indian community in Ukraine. While back home in India people were
                                        transfixed by the massive evacuation of Indian medical students from Ukraine,
                                        choices for long-term Indian residents of the country were tough. Having
                                        dedicated decades to businesses and connections here, they simply couldn’t pack
                                        up and leave. “I had to shift my factory from Kyiv to Marshyntsy in Chernivtsi
                                        Oblast near the border with Romania. So many of my workers and their family
                                        members depended on me. I couldn’t abandon them,” says Nagender Parashar whose
                                        prosthetics manufacturing business and prosthetics centres have become a crucial
                                        source of hope for hundreds of Ukrainian amputees maimed by the war, “Slowly, I
                                        had to bring my staff to Marshyntsy and continue my work.” Ram Dange, another
                                        long-term Indian resident and businessman, elaborates on the challenges faced by
                                        the Indian community in Kyiv. “There were around 2,500 long-term Indian
                                        residents in Ukraine before 2022. Many of us got married and have families here.
                                        The outbreak of full-fledged war divided our families because we had to relocate
                                        our loved ones to safer locations and countries. But we had to stay behind for
                                        the sake of our businesses. We are now looking forward to PM Modi’s visit and
                                        have even made a joint appeal to him. We fully support his rejection of force in
                                        any dispute, and he should intervene to bring about a resolution to this heinous
                                        war.”

                                        Modi’s visit is the first by a sitting Indian PM to independent Ukraine. Mridula
                                        Ghosh, professor of international relations at National University of
                                        Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, senses a possible shift in India’s position. “Many see the
                                        visit as a balancing act of damage control after Modi’s visit to Russia last
                                        month, during which Moscow rained missiles over Ukraine. But this visit could
                                        also indicate some shift away from the Russian sphere of influence. Modi coming
                                        here will certainly open a new chapter in ties between India and Ukraine with
                                        political engagement at the highest level”. Parashar adds, “From our point of
                                        view this visit will help restore our self-respect. Since the beginning of the
                                        full-scale war, we Indians have faced criticism over India’s neutral position
                                        towards the conflict. Modi meeting President Zelensky will help counter that
                                        perception among Ukrainians and make our lives a little bit easier.”

                                        Warsaw, Aug 22 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday had a "fruitful"
                                        exchange of views with a group of prominent Polish Indologists here and he
                                        deeply appreciated their work on Indian culture, language and arts as well as

                                        group of Indologists included Prof. Maria Christopher Byrski, Prof. Monika

                                        Indian history and culture. We talked about ways to make Indology more
                                        widespread. The distinguished academics also expressed joy at the increasing
                                        popularity of Yoga across Poland and Europe," Modi said in a post on X.

                                        Modi made the remarks after holding wide-ranging talks with Polish Prime
