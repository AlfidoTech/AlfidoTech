        <p><strong>Alfido Tech</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore adopted
            a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Cancellation Requests</h3>
        <p>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 2-3 days of placing the order. However,
            the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors or
            merchants and they have initiated the shipping process.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Non-Cancellable Items</h3>
        <p>Alfido Tech does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However,
            refunds or replacements can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is
            unsatisfactory.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Damaged or Defective Items</h3>
        <p>In the event of receiving damaged or defective items, please report this to our Customer Service team. The
            request will be considered once the merchant has verified the condition at their end. This should be
            reported within 2-3 days of receiving the products.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Product Not as Expected</h3>
        <p>If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or does not meet your expectations, you
            must bring this to the attention of our Customer Service team within 2-3 days of receipt. After reviewing
            your complaint, our team will take an appropriate decision.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Warranty-Related Complaints</h3>
        <p>For products covered under manufacturer warranties, please contact the manufacturer directly for issues.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Refund Processing</h3>
        <p>If Alfido Tech approves any refunds, it will take approximately 3-4 days for the refund to be processed and
            credited to the customer’s account.</p>
